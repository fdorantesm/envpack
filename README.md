# ðŸ“¦ Envpack

Have you ever been asked to share the environment files of a large monorepo with more than a dozen apps?
<br>
In that case you probably created an exact structure file by file... local, development, staging, qa, preproduction, production, etc, per app, per teammate, because you probably deleted that zip or it is not updated.
<br>
If you still reading up to this point you know what it does mean.

Envpack lets you zip and unzip all your .env files keeping original paths.

### Installation

Globally,

```sh
$ npm i -g envpack
```

<br>
As project dependency

```sh
$ npm i -D envpack
```
